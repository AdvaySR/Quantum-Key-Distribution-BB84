![BB84 Protocol]

## Why Quantum Cryptography?
- Traditional encryption (RSA) will be broken by quantum computers
- BB84 protocol uses quantum mechanics for **provable security**

## How My Simulator Works
```python
# Key generation snippet
def encode_qubit(bit, basis):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
    if basis == 'Ã—': qc.h(0)
    if bit == 1: qc.x(0)
    return qc
```
